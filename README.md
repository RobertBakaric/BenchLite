# Description

Benchmarking is the practice of comparing processes and performance metrics to
industry standard best practice solutions. Parameters typically considered
during measurement process are:

a) quality of the resulting output,
b) execution time
c) memory usage
d) disc usage

"bench" is a simple cli application that utilizes all of the above stated quantifiations
schemas and crunches out a simple descriptive statistical summary for a set of measurements
obtained from direct cli app executions
